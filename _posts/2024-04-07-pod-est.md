Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), also known as Karhunen-Lo√©ve decomposition [1] is a popular method in engineering analysis 
to obtain the approximation of lower dimension representation of turbulent flows [2], structural analysis [3], and dynamical system [4]. In simple terms, POD transforms the full solution of a vector field into a set of simpler representations that can be easily handled. For example, we can decompose the fluid flow vector field as shown in image/video below to its simpler representation:

<br/>

If you are unfamiliar with this concept, you might be questioning "Why would I need a simpler/lower dimension representation of the fluid flow?". One of the most common uses is that we can use the lower dimension representation of the problem to **predict** the behaviour of the problem/system given unknown parameter(s). For example, if the video above depicts fluid flow from $t=0$ to $t=5$, we can use the lower-dimensional representation to predict the flow's shape at $t=6$.

Consider that a single vector field can be constructed from a few to millions of elements or discretization points. Predicting each element for every time step is a complex task. Therefore, by employing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), we simplify the problem by predicting the lower-dimensional representation of the system rather than each individual element.

## POD Formulation
### Input Data
POD requires an input format in the shape of $N \times m$ where $N$ is the number of elements or discretization in the problem, and $m$ is the number of parameter variations. In the context of our fluid flow scenario, the varying parameter is time $t$. Therefore, if desired, you can replace $m$ with $t$ in our current example. However, for the sake of generalization, I am using $m$. This $N \times m$ matrix is often referred to as the **snapshot matrix**. The schematic of the snapshot matrix construction is given in Figure 2:

In the context of our fluid flow case, we should flatten the flow field data at each time step as shown in Figure 3. The flattened data are then arranged in a way such that each column of the snapshot matrix represents one timestep.

To make things to be more practical, I will provide the Python code as a companion. The dataset that is used in this article can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D-djGay_yPW7mScOA4XLysrUs1DXIkB9/view?usp=share_link).

The given dataset has several components, namely `U_star` (x and y velocity field component), `p_star` (pressure field), `t_star` (time stamp), and `X_star` (spatial coordinate). In this article, we will only consider the **x velocity** component as our variable of interest and the spatial coordinate for plotting. First, we extract the dataset

 ```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.io
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = scipy.io.loadmat("cylinder_nektar_wake.mat")
u_star = data['U_star']  # N x 2 x T -- 2 indicates u_x (1st axis) and u_y (2nd axis)
p_star = data['p_star']  # N x T
t_star = data['t']  # T x 1
x_star = data['X_star']  # N x 2
```
Notice that all variables are already flattened. So actually, we don't need to flatten each variable by ourselves. However, it is important to know that for plotting purposes, we need to reshape the spatial coordinates `x_star` into the desired shape of $50 \times 100$. Notice that the shape of `x_star` is $N \times 2$, where the first column corresponds to the $x$ coordinate and the second column corresponds to $y$ coordinate.

```python
# Reshape Data
x_grid = x_star[:,0].reshape(50,100)
y_grid = x_star[:,1].reshape(50,100)
```
As we have decided that we will only consider the **x velocity** component as our variable of interest, we will only select the first component of the second axis from u_star `u_star[:,0,:]`. Notice that by selecting this, we already make an $N \times T$ matrix, which is the intended shape of our snapshot matrix. Therefore:

```python
snapshot = u_star[:,0,:]
```
Up to this point, we are basically done. However, if you want to plot one realization (one timestep) from the snapshot matrix, you can choose one column from the snapshot matrix, reshape the selected column into $50 \times 100$, and then plot a contour. The plotting result is supposed to look like Figure 4

```python
single_snapshot = snapshot[:,42]  # Select one column (any column, here I choose column 42)
ux_grid = single_snapshot.reshape(50,100)  # Reshape selected column to 50 x 100

# Simple Plotting
plt.contourf(X_grid,Y_grid,u_grid)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
```

### Matrix Decomposition
At the core of POD is the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique [5], which you may have encountered in your linear algebra course. For those who may have forgotten their linear algebra lessons or have not studied it, I'll make sure to explain the concept of POD as clearly and simply as possible.

Supposed that we have any matrix $Y$, we can decompose $Y$ into $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$ matrices (I will not dive into the details of the matrix decomposition, as nowadays we can use a library such as [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html) to perform SVD. However, if you are interested I strongly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBcLRGuAFUk) by Prof. Gilbert Strang himself üòâ) 

$$
Y = U \Sigma_r V^T
$$

In the context of our fluid flow POD, the $Y$ matrix serves as our snapshot matrix. Matrix $U$ can be interpreted as a matrix that represents spatial components. Similarly, matrix $V$ is a matrix that represents the other parameter components, or in this case, the time component. The $\Sigma_r$ matrix is an $r$-rank diagonal matrix that represents the "strength" or the importance of the corresponding basis. The diagonal of $\Sigma_r$ consists of the singular values of $Y$ which are arranged in decreasing order such that $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_r$. The rank $r$ of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is determined by the smallest number between $N$ and $m$, mathematically written as $\min(N,m)$. The corresponding shape after the decomposition process is illustrated in Figure 5.

In Python, the SVD decomposition can be done easily. Here, we should pass the parameter `full_matrices=False` in order to get the desired output shape. Otherwise, we won't get the desired shape (you can read further (here)[https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html]). As explained in the documentation, the default shape of `s` is a $r \times 1$ array, which mean in order to be consistent with our definition of $\Sigma_r$ we should transform it into a diagonal matrix. You should also pay attention that the output `vt` is already the transposed version of $V$.
```python
u,s,vt = np.linalg.svd(snapshot,full_matrices=False)
sigma = np.diag(s)
```

By assuming that $r = \min(N,m)$, you might notice that the final dimension of matrix $U$ is still the same with the original snapshot matrix. The fact that the decomposition result holds the same shape with the original matrix is computationally memory inefficient. Thus, we can further truncate $r$ by choosing a number $k$ such that $k < r$. First, we can set $k$ as a user-defined variable. Or second we can approximate the number of $k$ by:

$$
\begin{gathered}
  \frac{\sum^k_{i=1} \sigma_i}{\sum^r_{i=1} \sigma_i} \geq \alpha, \quad k\in \mathbb{Z}^+\\
  r = \min(N,m),
\end{gathered}
$$

where $\sigma_i$ is the diagonal element of $Sigma$ arranged in decreasing order such that $\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_r$. Variable $\alpha$ can be interpreted as the amount of "variation" that can be explained by the truncated model. Or, in my free interpretation, it's the level of "accuracy" that we would like to retain in the truncated model. We typically choose $\alpha = 0.99$. (Note: the code for user-defined k and the corresponding truncation is left to the reader as an exercise.)
```python
# Determine number k
temp = 0
alpha = 0.99
diagsum = np.sum(s)
for idx, sigma in enumerate(s):
    temp += sigma
    ratio = temp/diagsum

    if ratio >= alpha:
        k = idx
        break

# truncate matrices
s_trunc = s[:k]
u_trunc = u[:,:k]
vt_trunc = vt[:k,:]
sigma_trunc = np.diag(s_trunc)
```
Hence, now we have:

$$
Y \approx U_k \Sigma_k V^T_k
$$

In POD, we often define a POD coefficients $B$, where $B_k = \Sigma_k V^T_k$, $B_k \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times m}$. Thus, our equation now becomes:

$$
Y \approx U_k B_k
$$
