# Quick Introduction

A Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical model that is often used for the stochastic decision-making process of a dynamic system. In this context, the system's outcomes are influenced by both random factors and the decisions made by an agent, who must make a series of sequential decisions over time. The basic building block of an MDP consists of 4 tuples $(S,A,P_a,R_a)$, where:
* $S$ is a set of states, which is often called *state space*.
* $A$ is a set of actions called *action space* ($A_s$ would be the set of available actions from state $s$).
* $P_a(s,s') = P_a(s_{t+1} = s'|s_t=s, a_t=a)$ is the probability of the action $a$ in state $s$ and time $t$ will lead to state $s'$.
* $R_a(s,s')$ is the immediate (or **expected immediate**) reward of taking action $a$ to transition from state $s$ to state $s'$
