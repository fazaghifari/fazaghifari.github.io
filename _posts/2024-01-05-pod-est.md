This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Testing equation
======

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
$$

Testing code snippet
======

```python
def fun(x):
    return x + x/2
```

Aren't headings cool?
