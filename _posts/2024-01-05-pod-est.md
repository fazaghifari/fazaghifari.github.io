Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), also known as Karhunen-Loéve decomposition [1] is a popular method in engineering analysis 
to obtain the approximation of lower dimension representation of turbulent flows [2], structural analysis [3], and dynamical system [4]. In simple terms, POD transforms the full solution of a vector field into a set of simpler representations that can be easily handled. For example, we can decompose the fluid flow vector field as shown in image/video below to its simpler representation:

If you are unfamiliar with this concept, you might be questioning "Why would I need a simpler/lower dimension representation of the fluid flow?". One of the most common uses is that we can use the lower dimension representation of the problem to **predict** the behaviour of the problem/system given unknown parameter(s). For example, if the video above depicts fluid flow from $t=0$ to $t=5$, we can use the lower-dimensional representation to predict the flow's shape at $t=6$.

Consider that a single vector field can be constructed from a few to millions of elements or discretization points. Predicting each element for every time step is a complex task. Therefore, by employing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), we simplify the problem by predicting the lower-dimensional representation of the system rather than each individual element.

## POD Formulation
### Input Data
POD requires an input format in the shape of $N \times m$ where $N$ is the number of elements or discretization in the problem, and $m$ is the number of parameter variations. In the context of our fluid flow scenario, the varying parameter is time $t$. Therefore, if desired, you can replace $m$ with $t$ in our current example. However, for the sake of generalization, I am using $m$. This $N \times m$ matrix is often referred to as the **snapshot matrix**. The schematic of the snapshot matrix construction is given in Figure 2 and 3 below:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{f}
$$
