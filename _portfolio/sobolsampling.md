[Sobol sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) are an example of quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences. They were first introduced by the Russian mathematician Ilya M. Sobol.

This Python function was translated from the original c++ program by Frances Kuo and Stephen Joe https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/
