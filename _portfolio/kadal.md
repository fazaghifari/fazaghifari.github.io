Kriging for Analysis, Design optimization, And expLoration (KADAL) is [Flow Diagnostics Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/) in-house Python code that contains collections of Bayesian Optimization tools including various surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and optimization methods. Some surrogate models that included in our program are Ordinary Kriging, Regression Kriging, Polynomial Kriging, Composite Kernel Kriging, and Kriging with Partial Least Square. In Bayesian optimization module, we have Single Objective Bayesian Optimization (SOBO) algorithm using Expected Improvement (EI) and Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) using Pareto efficient global optimization (ParEGO) and Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) algorithm. We also have uncertainty quantification (UQ) module, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) module based on Sobol Indices, and reliability analysis module based on Active Kriging â€“ Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS). Our code is under active development and we aim to incorporate more sophisticated methods.
