Hi! I am Ghifari a recent MSc graduate in aerospace engineering from ITB and also a research assistant at [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/) with interest in design optimization, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning. Currently, I am looking for an internship position with an opportunity to full-time job or a regular full-time job in data science and analytics. During my university life, my prior works include developing a framework for engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration using machine learning algorithms as well as doing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). 

I have no specific hobby, but I do love playing games, playing badminton, and running. I also love experimenting with food in my mom's kitchen and sometimes, when I have nothing to do I spent my time scrolling twitter timeline.üòÅ
