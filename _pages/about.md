Hi! I am Ghifari a Data Scientist at [Valiance](https://valiance.ai/) and also a research collaborator at [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/). My interest lies between design optimization, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning. My prior works include developing a framework for engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration using machine learning algorithms as well as performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). 

I do love playing games, badminton, tennis, or just strolling around. Or you can find me very active retweeting cats on twitter :satisfied:

I am open for research collaboration and project-based job. I also love meeting new friends. E-mail me at **ghifariadamf[at]gmail[dot]com**
