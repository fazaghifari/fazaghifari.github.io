Hi There! I'm Adam, a PhD student at KU Leuven working on Epistemic AI. Alongside my research, I like to call myself a (self-proclaimed) Data Scientist ðŸ˜œ and am also an unofficial research collaborator at the [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/). My current interests revolve around design optimisation, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning for engineering applications. 

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked professionally as a Data Scientist, contributing to the development of Knowledge Graph extraction models and other machine learning systems. During my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s studies, I was involved in research on applying machine learning to engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration â€” as well as tackling computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) projects. 

Outside of work, I like to experiment with my cooking, play tennis, badminton, or just stroll around the city. Youâ€™ll often find me on X (Twitter), actively retweeting cats and all sorts of random fun.

Iâ€™m always open to research collaborations, project-based opportunities, or just meeting new friends. Feel free to reach out â€” you can poke me at **ghifariadamf[at]gmail[dot]com**
