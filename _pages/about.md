Hi! I am Ghifari a Data Scientist at [Pacmann.ai](https://pacmann.ai/) and also a research collaborator at [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/). My interest lies between design optimization, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning. My prior works include developing a framework for engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration using machine learning algorithms as well as performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). 

I have no specific hobby, but I do love playing games, playing badminton, and riding bicycle. I also love experimenting with food in my mom's kitchen and sometimes, when I have nothing to do I spend my time on twitter.üòÅ
