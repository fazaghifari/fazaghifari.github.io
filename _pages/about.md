Hello there! I am Adam, a self-proclaimed Data Scientist and an incoming PhD student at KU Leuven with the topic of [Epistemic AI](http://epistemic-ai.eu). I am also an unofficial research collaborator at [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/). Currently, I have interests in optimization, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning for engineering applications. Prior to this, I worked as a professional Data Scientist that involved in the development of Knowledge Graph extraction models and other general ML models to solve business problems. In my Bachelor's and Master's studies, I was also involved in some research related to the development of a framework for engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration using machine learning algorithms as well as performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). 

I love playing games, badminton, tennis, or just strolling around the city. Most of the time, you can find me actively retweeting cats and other random kinds of stuff on Twitter.

I am open to research collaboration and project-based jobs. I also love meeting new friends. Poke me at **ghifariadamf[at]gmail[dot]com**
