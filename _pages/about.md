Hello there! I am Ghifari, a self-proclaimed Data Scientist and current pingpong champion :rofl: at [Valiance](https://valiance.ai/). I am also an unofficial research collaborator at [Flow Diagnostic Lab](https://flowdiagnostics.ftmd.itb.ac.id/). Currently, I have interest in optimization, uncertainty analysis, and machine learning towards engineering application. My prior works include developing a framework for engineering design analysis, optimization, and exploration using machine learning algorithms as well as performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). 

I do love playing games, badminton, tennis, or just strolling around the city. Most of the time, you can find me very active retweeting cats on twitter :satisfied:

I am open for research collaboration and project-based job. I also love meeting new friends. Poke me at **ghifariadamf[at]gmail[dot]com**
